### Integration of the generic tests into the java3 sdk
#### To run locally need to be installed:
 - nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/
 - yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install
 - docker: https://www.docker.com/get-started
 - java
 
#### Inside the eyes.selenium.java module, could be used JS generic tool, there are available cli commands:
##### All the commands should be executed from the ${projectRoot}/eyes.selenium.java/
 - yarn java (used on Travis) - install nodejs dependencies => starts docker container for the selenium => generate generic tests => run testng suite => report the result to the QA sandbox dashboard
 - yarn release (used on Travis) - Same as yarn java but send report results to the QA production dashboard(HTML report is generated from the data accumulated on the QA production dashboard).
 - yarn local - install nodejs dependencies (without creating lockfile, so it will always install latest version of the tool) => start docker container for the selenium =>generate generic tests => run testng suite => report results to the QA sandbox dashboard => stop and remove docker container for the selenium
 - yarn generate - command generate generic tests
 - yarn test - command generate generic tests and run the generic test suite
 - yarn report - command send the report to QA sandbox dashboard
 - yarn report:prod - command send the report to QA production dashboard
 - yarn move:report - move the report generated from the testng run, from the target directory to the current working directory (DIR_PATH/eyes.selenium.java/). During the reporting JS tool will look for the 2 files, coverage-test-report.xml
coverage-tests-metadata.json which should be at cwd.
 - mvn test -DsuiteFile=genericTestsSuite.xml - is command which run the generic tests testng suite.
